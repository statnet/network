CHANGELOG:

v1.4 New Functions, New Features, Changes, and Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - is.na.network: returns a network whose edges correspond to missing edges
      in the original network.  (Also supported by new backend function 
      isNANetwork_R.)  [CTB]
    - network.naedgecount: returns the number of missing edges in a network
      object.  [CTB]
    - Internal functions summary.character and print.summary.character have
      been added for use with network print/summary methods.  [MSH]
    - Internal function is.color has been added to allow heuristic
      identification of color names (for use with attribute plotting).  
      as.color similarly attempts to coerce its input into some reasonable
      color value for display purposes.  [CTB]
  New Features:
    - The network edge assignment operator ([<-.network) now allows NAs to be
      given as assignment values (resulting in missing edges if no attribute
      specified, or missing attribute values otherwise).  [CTB]
    - The C-level network API headers are now contained in the "inst" directory;
      from now on, they will be maintained there.  [CTB]
    - read.paj now imports vertex attributes.  [Patch submitted by Alexander
      Montgomery]
  Changes:
    - Many minor documentation updates (including adding references to the 
      recent JSS article).  [CTB]
    - CITATION file has been updated to reflect current R standards.  [CTB]
    - Color support in plot.network.default has been greatly expanded and
      rationalized.  [CTB]
    - is.adjacent now sets na.omit=FALSE by default; there seems to be a general
      consensus that this results in the more obvious pattern of behavior
      (i.e., missing edges from i to j result in a value of NA, unless there 
      are also non-missing (i,j) edges present).  The man page has also been
      updated to describe this behavior in greater detail.  [CTB]
    - Per the above, as.sociomatrix and related coercion methods also now
      display missing data information by default.  [CTB]
    - summary.network now returns a summary.network object, and printing takes
      place within print.summary.network (which is standard R behavior).
      Something approximately like this was being done before, but behavior
      should now be more conventional; summary.network objects can also carry
      optional information as network attributes with names of the form
      "summary.*". [CTB; Submitted by DRH]
    - plot.network.default now automagically displays labels if manually
      supplied (following the behavior of sna's gplot).  [CTB]
    - print.network now shows missing edge information.  [CTB]
    - The man page for network.dyadcount now emphasizes the fact that
      directed dyads are returned when is.directed(x)==TRUE.  (This was noted
      in the example, but was explicitly discussed in the main page.)  [CTB;
      Submitted by DRH]
    - as.matrix.network.edgelist and as.matrix.network.incidence now return
      degenerate matrices instead of NULL when called with an empty graph.
      [Pavel Krivitsky]
    - Undocumented support for the design matrix and special "respondent"
      attributes should be considered deprecated, and will be removed in the
      next version.  [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - as.matrix.network.edgelist dropped the dimensions of its output when
      called on a graph with one edge.  [CTB]
    - as.matrix.network.incidence produced an error when called with an 
      empty graph, and generated incorrect matrices when called with graphs
      containing missing or previously deleted edges.  [CTB]
    - get.neighborhood was incorrectly including ego for loopless undirected
      graphs.  [CTB]
    - list.vertex.attributes produced an error when called on networks with
      different attributes on each vertex.  [CTB]
    - plot.network.default was not displaying colors as advertised in some
      cases [CTB; Submitted by Cori Mar]
    - print.network and summary.network were giving ugly output.  [MSH]
    - read.paj was reversing arc directions.  [CTB; Submitted by Kevin Lewis]
    - The initial startup message was giving the wrong help command.  [CTB;
      Submitted by Kevin Zembower]
    - read.paj was failing in some cases.  [Pavel Krivitsky]
    - summary.network didn't call the mixing matrix summary properly.  [MSH]
v1.3 New Functions, New Features, Changes, and Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - network.vertex.names<-: simplified assignment for vertex names.  [CTB]
  New Features:
    - A CITATION file has now been added to the package, to encourage good
      behavior.  The initial on-load announcements have been tweaked
      accordingly.  [CTB]
  Changes:
    - add.edges (via the backend routine add_edges_R) now adds edges in a
      more efficient way; substantial performance gains should be observed
      when adding multiple edges at one time, versus previous package
      versions.  [CTB]
    - network print and summary methods now consistently refer to "vertex 
      attributes" instead of "nodal attributes."  [CTB]
    - network constructors now set vertex names by default; this brings the
      actual behavior of the package in line with its apparent behavior (since
      network.vertex names and similar routines will "fake" vertex names if 
      none are present, thus producing results which are inconsistent with
      get.vertex.attribute in the latter case).  [CTB]
    - The DESCRIPTION file has been tweaked to be a bit more professional, and
      to add the statnet web site.  [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed "virtual subsetting" for network objects when a single vector of
      virtual cell numbers is provided, or when a one-row, two-column matrix is
      given.  In both cases, network was treating the numbers as if they were
      first-column selectors.  [CTB]
    - Direct assignment to internal components of network objects was failing
      in certain cases. This has been fixed, although users should note that
      this behavior is both unsupported and generally a Bad Idea (TM).  Please
      use interface methods instead!  [CTB; Submitted by Skye Bender-deMoll]
    - Fixed bug in read.paj.  [MSH]
    - Fixed display of attribute information in summary.network.  [MSH]
    - plot.network is now compatible with the updated ergm package.  [CTB]
    - Previously implemented functionality in plot.network allowing one-word
      specification of vertex or edge attributes for display parameters was
      not working uniformly.  [CTB]
v1.2 New Functions, Changes, Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - $<-.network: replacement method for network objects.  [CTB]
    - sum.network, prod.network: sums and products of multiple network 
      objects.  [CTB]
  Changes:
    - Direct assignments with network objects on the right-hand side now copy
      their right-hand argument (per standard R semantics).  Originally, a 
      pointer to the right-hand argument was copied (and network.copy was 
      required for direct assignment).  The direct use of network.copy is now
      unnecessary for most purposes, and should be avoided.  [CTB]
    - network.density now allows explicit control of missing data behavior,
      support for ignoring "structural zeros" (per bipartite), and supports
      a wider range of hypergraphic cases.  [CTB]
    - Some adjustments have been made to the overloading of network arithmetic
      operators, to ensure compatibility with future versions of R.  Most
      importantly, the passing of an attrname argument to arithmetic operators
      is now defunct (since it violates the S3 generics).  The addition of
      more general sum and prod methods hopefully make up for this 
      regression.  [CTB]
    - The network extraction and assignment operators now behave more like 
      conventional matrices.  In particular, single vectors are assumed to 
      contain lists of cell indices (when given in isolation), and one-row,
      two-column matrices are treated as other two-column matrices.  [CTB]
    - Various minor documentation and test file updates.  [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - as.matrix arguments have been modified to harmonize with the new R (2.5)
      generics definitions.  [CTB]
    - Annoying but harmless tracer messages have been removed.  [CTB]
    - Protection stack could overflow when large numbers of edges were deleted
      in a single call.  [CTB; Submitted by Pavel Krivitsky]
v1.1-2 Changes, Bug Fixes
  Changes:
    - getNeighborhood, getEdges, and getEdgeIDs (internal) now force
      type="combined" behavior on undirected networks; this was done at the R
      level before, but is now enforced in C as well.  This is not generally
      user-level transparent, but affects the experimental network API [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - as.network.matrix was not setting the bipartite attribute of the returned
      network properly, when called with a non-FALSE bipartite argument [MSH]
    - An error was present in some error return functions, causing errors on
      errors (which, happily, were only relevant when an error occurred)
      [CTB; Submitted by Skye Bender-deMoll]
v1.1-1 New Functions, Changes
  New Functions:
    - The internal function setVertexAttribute has been added.  This has
      no immediate user-level effect, but the new function is supported
      in the C API [CTB]
  Changes:
    - Use of the protection stack has been changed, so as to avoid racking up
      huge stacks when creating very large networks.  This is expected to have
      a minimal impact on performance, but will avoid protection stack overflow
      issues in some cases  [CTB]
    - A change in R 2.4.0 has apparently made it impossible for generic 
      two-argument Ops (e.g., +,-,*) to dispatch to functions with more than
      two arguments.  A side effect of this is that "+.network" and friends
      must be called with the full function name (as opposed to simply "+") 
      when the optional attrname argument is being used.  Note that this is
      not a change in the network package (although the test code has been
      updated to reflect it), but a regression due to R.  Go complain to the
      R team  [CTB]
v1.1 New Features, Bug Fixes, Changes
  New Features:
    - [.network and [<-.network now allow the use of vertex names (where
      present) for selection of vertices [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - add.vertices did not verify the integrity of vattr, and could generate
      a segfault if incorrectly called with a non-null, non-list value [CTB;
      reported by Skye Bender-deMoll]
    - as.network (and friends) could segfault if matrix.type was forced
      to adjacency while bipartite>0; new behavior essentially forces the
      use of the bipartite matrix method in this case [CTB]
    - delete.edges and set.edge.attribute returned an annoying (but harmless)
      warning when called with zero-length eid [CTB; reported by David Hunter]
    - delete.vertices did not adjust bipartite attribute (where present) to
      account for loss of mode 1 vertices [CTB]
    - get.vertex.attribute generated an error when called with na.omit=TRUE
      in some cases [CTB]
    - network.incidence could not be used to construct undirected dyadic
      networks [CTB]
    - set.vertex.attribute generated an error if called with attribute lists
      of length != network.size [CTB; reported by Skye Bender-deMoll]
  Changes:
    - Added a new overview man page (network-package) with information on how
      to get started with network [CTB]
    - [<-.network will now remove edges with zero values if both names.eval and
      add.edges are set, and will not add edges for those cells.  Previously,
      the standard behavior was to add edges for all cells [CTB]
    - Added delete.edges to the "see also" for add.edges [CTB; suggested by
      Skye Bender-deMoll]
    - permute.vertexIDs now throws a warning when called with a cross-mode
      vertex exchange on a bipartite graph [CTB]
    - Default matrix type for as.matrix.network is now "adjacency," rather than
      the output of which.matrix.type().  Coercion methods should not have
      variable behavior depending on features such as network size, even if
      it is convenient for some purposes!  The old behavior can be easily
      obtained via setting matrix.type=which.matrix.type(x), for those who
      want it [CTB]
v1.0-1 Minor Bug Fixes, Changes
  Bug Fixes:
    - Various warnings were removed (apparently, these only appeared in 
      R<2.1) [CTB]
    - plot.network was failing on networks where is.bipartite==TRUE [CTB]
  Changes:
    - The generic form of %c% was temporarily removed, to avoid namespace
      issues with sna.  (This will be rectified in future releases.) [CTB]
v1.0 New Functions, New Features, Changes, and Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - Operator overloading for +, -, *, |, &, and ! have been added, as has the
      composition operator, %c% [CTB]
    - Operator overloading is now supported for "[" and "[<-"; this allows
      network objects to be treated transparently as if they were adjacency
      matrices (in some cases, at least).  New extraction/replacement operators
      %n%, %n%<-, %v%, %v%<- have been added for extracting/assigning values to
      network and vertex attributes (respectively) [CTB]
    - network.copy: returns a copy of the input network [CTB]
    - network.dyadcount: return the number of dyads in a network (optionally
      adjusting for the missing dyads) [MSH]
  New Features:
    - add.edges now checks for illegal loop-like edges when edge.check==TRUE
      [CTB]
    - get.neighborhood now allows users to specify whether missing edges should
      be ignored [CTB]
    - set.edge.value now accepts edge values in vector format [CTB]
  Changes:
    - All access access functions now modify their arguments in place; this
      greatly improves performance, but may produce unexpected behavior.
      If users wish to generate a modified copy of a network, they must
      first generate the copy and then modify it.  Otherwise, the old
      object will be modified as well. In accordance with this, modification
      methods now return their (modified) arguments invisibly.  [CTB]
    - Most access functions have now been backended; this has improved the
      performance of many operations by as much as two orders of magnitude [CTB]
    - get.edges and get.edgeIDs now treat all undirected networks as if
      called with neighborhood=="combined" [CTB]
    - as.matrix.network.incidence now handles undirected edges in a more
      conventional way [CTB]
    - network.adjacency will now ignore diagonal entries if has.loops=FALSE 
      [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - as.network.edgelist and as.network.incidence were producing spurious edge
      attributes [CTB]
    - list.edge.attributes generated failed under certain conditions (submitted
      by Matthew Wiener) [CTB]
    - set.edge.attribute was able to write attributes into non-existent (NULL)
      edges [CTB]
    - set.edge.value could exhibit strange behavior when carelessly chosen
      edge subsets were selected [CTB]
    
v0.5-4 New Facilities for Bipartite, New Features, Changes, and Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - network.bipartite to store an explicit bipartite network.
      Modified network.initialize, etc, to accept "bipartite" argument. [MSH]
    - is.bipartite: logical test for a bipartite network [MSH]
    - read.paj: read one or more network objects from a Pajek file [MSH, DS]
  New Features:
    - summary.network now reports on edge attributes [MSH]
  Changes:
    - The composition operator (%c%) has been removed due to a name conflict
      with the sna package; since sna now supports network objects, its
      version can be used instead. [CTB]
    - as.sociomatrix is now properly configured to work in tandem with 
      as.sociomatrix.sna (in the sna package).  The functionality of the 
      routine has also been extended slightly.  [CTB]
  Bug Fixes:
    - .First.lib: Print out correct welcome banner for package [MSH]
    - Fix displayisolates determination in plot.network.default [MSH]

v0.5-3 New Functions, New Data Set, and Changes
  New Functions:
    - permute.vertexIDs: Permute vertices in their internal representation [CTB]
  New Data:
    - emon: Drabek et al.'s Emergent Multi-organizational Networks [CTB]
  Changes:
    - The obsolete examples directory has been removed. [CTB]

v0.5-2 New Features, New Functions and Bug Fixes
  New Functions:
    - delete.vertices: Remove one or more vertices (and associated edges)
      from a network object.
    - delete.edge.attribute, delete.network.attribute, delete.vertex attribute:
      Remove an edge/network/vertex attribute.
    - list.edge.attributes, list.network.attributes, list.vertex attributes:
      List all edge/network/vertex attribute names.
  New Features:
    - plot.graph.default now accepts vertex/edge attribute names for most
      vertex/edge display properties.
  Bug Fixes:
    - Edge deletion produced exciting and unexpected behavior in some cases.
    - network.initialize set vertex na attributes to TRUE by default.
