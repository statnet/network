\format{
A list of 7 \code{\link{network}} objects:

Each network has one edge attribute:

\tabular{lll}{ Frequency \tab numeric \tab Interaction frequency (1-4;
1=most frequent) }

Each network also has 8 vertex attributes:

 \tabular{lll}{
  Command.Rank.Score  \tab numeric   \tab Mean rank in the command structure\cr
  Decision.Rank.Score \tab numeric   \tab Mean rank in the decision process\cr

\description{
Drabek et al. (1981) provide seven case studies of emergent
multi-organizational networks (EMONs) in the context of search and rescue
(SAR) activities.  Networks of interaction frequency are reported, along
with several organizational attributes.
}
\details{
All networks collected by Drabek et al. reflect reported frequency of
organizational interaction during the search and rescue effort; the (i,j)
edge constitutes i's report regarding interaction with j, with non-adjacent
vertices reporting no contact.  Frequency is rated on a four-point scale,
with 1 indicating the highest frequency of interaction.  (Response options:
1=\dQuote{continuously}, 2=\dQuote{about once an hour}, 3=\dQuote{every few
hours}, 4=\dQuote{about once a day or less}) This is stored within the
\code{"Frequency"} edge attribute.

For each network, several covariates are recorded as vertex attributes:

\describe{
\item{Command.Rank.Score}{ Mean (reversed) rank for the
  prominence of each organization in the command structure of the response, as
  judged by organizational informants.}
\item{Decision.Rank.Score}{ Mean (reversed) rank for the 
  prominence of each organization in decision making
  processes during the response, as judged by organizational informants.}
\item{Formalization}{ An index of organizational formalization, ranging from
  0 (least formalized) to 4 (most formalized).} \item{Localization}{ For each
  organization, \code{"L"} if the organization was sited locally to the impact
  area, \code{"NL"} if the organization was not sited near the impact area,
  \code{"B"} if the organization was sited at both local and non-local
  locations.}
\item{Paid.Staff}{ Number of paid staff employed by each
  organization at the time of the response.}
\item{Sponsorship}{ The level at which each organization
  was sponsored (e.g., \code{"City"}, \code{"County"},
  \code{"State"}, \code{"Federal"}, and \code{"Private"}).}
\item{vertex.names}{ The identity of each organization.}
\item{Volunteer.Staff}{ Number of volunteer staff employed by each
  organization at the time of the response.}
}

Note that where intervals were given by the original source, midpoints have
been substituted.  For detailed information regarding data coding and
procedures, see Drabek et al. (1981).
