\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{network}.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{attrname}{an optional edge attribute, to be used to set edge values.}

\item{label}{a vector of vertex labels, if desired; defaults to the vertex
labels returned by \code{\link{network.vertex.names}}. If \code{label} has
one element and it matches with a vertex attribute name, the value of the
attribute will be used. Note that labels may be set but hidden by the
\code{displaylabels} argument.}

\item{coord}{user-specified vertex coordinates, in an network.size(x)x2
matrix.  Where this is specified, it will override the \code{mode} setting.}

\item{jitter}{boolean; should the output be jittered?}

\item{thresh}{real number indicating the lower threshold for tie values.
Only ties of value >\code{thresh} are displayed.  By default,
\code{thresh}=0.}

\item{usearrows}{boolean; should arrows (rather than line segments) be used
to indicate edges?}

\item{mode}{the vertex placement algorithm; this must correspond to a
\code{\link{network.layout}} function.}

\item{displayisolates}{boolean; should isolates be displayed?}

\item{interactive}{boolean; should interactive adjustment of vertex
placement be attempted?}

\item{xlab}{x axis label.}

\item{ylab}{y axis label.}

\item{xlim}{the x limits (min, max) of the plot.}

\item{ylim}{the y limits of the plot.}

\item{pad}{amount to pad the plotting range; useful if labels are being
clipped.}

\item{label.pad}{amount to pad label boxes (if \code{boxed.labels==TRUE}),
in character size units.}

\item{displaylabels}{boolean; should vertex labels be displayed?}

\item{boxed.labels}{boolean; place vertex labels within boxes?}

\item{label.pos}{position at which labels should be placed, relative to
vertices.  \code{0} results in labels which are placed away from the center
of the plotting region; \code{1}, \code{2}, \code{3}, and \code{4} result in
labels being placed below, to the left of, above, and to the right of
vertices (respectively); and \code{label.pos>=5} results in labels which are
plotted with no offset (i.e., at the vertex positions).}

\item{label.bg}{background color for label boxes (if
\code{boxed.labels==TRUE}); may be a vector, if boxes are to be of different
colors.}

\item{vertex.sides}{number of polygon sides for vertices; may be given as a
vector or a vertex attribute name, if vertices are to be of different types.
As of v1.12, radius of polygons are scaled so that all shapes have equal
area}

\item{vertex.rot}{angle of rotation for vertices (in degrees); may be given
as a vector or a vertex attribute name, if vertices are to be rotated
differently.}

\item{vertex.lwd}{line width of vertex borders; may be given as a vector or
a vertex attribute name, if vertex borders are to have different line
widths.}

\item{arrowhead.cex}{expansion factor for edge arrowheads.}

\item{label.cex}{character expansion factor for label text.}

\item{loop.cex}{expansion factor for loops; may be given as a vector or a

or edge attribute name, if edges are to be of different colors.}

vertex attribute name, if labels are to be of different colors.}

\item{vertex.col}{color for vertices; may be given as a vector or a vertex
attribute name, if vertices are to be of different colors.}

\item{label.border}{label border colors (if \code{boxed.labels==TRUE}); may
be given as a vector, if label boxes are to have different colors.}

\item{vertex.border}{border color for vertices; may be given as a vector or
a vertex attribute name, if vertex borders are to be of different colors.}

\item{edge.lty}{line type for edge borders; may be given as a vector,
adjacency matrix, or edge attribute name, if edge borders are to have
different line types.}

\item{label.lty}{line type for label boxes (if \code{boxed.labels==TRUE});
may be given as a vector, if label boxes are to have different line types.}

\item{vertex.lty}{line type for vertex borders; may be given as a vector or
a vertex attribute name, if vertex borders are to have different line types.}

\item{edge.lwd}{line width scale for edges; if set greater than 0, edge
widths are scaled by \code{edge.lwd*dat}.  May be given as a vector,
adjacency matrix, or edge attribute name, if edges are to have different
line widths.}

\item{edge.label}{if non-\code{NULL}, labels for edges will be drawn. May be
given as a vector, adjacency matrix, or edge attribute name, if edges are to
have different labels. A single value of \code{TRUE} will use edge ids as
labels. NOTE: currently doesn't work for curved edges.}

\item{edge.label.cex}{character expansion factor for edge label text; may be
given as a vector or a edge attribute name, if edge labels are to have
different sizes.}

\item{edge.label.col}{color for edge labels; may be given as a vector or a
edge attribute name, if labels are to be of different colors.}

\item{label.lwd}{line width for label boxes (if \code{boxed.labels==TRUE});
may be given as a vector, if label boxes are to have different line widths.}

\item{edge.len}{if \code{uselen==TRUE}, curved edge lengths are scaled by
\code{edge.len}.}

\item{edge.curve}{if \code{usecurve==TRUE}, the extent of edge curvature is
controlled by \code{edge.curv}.  May be given as a fixed value, vector,
adjacency matrix, or edge attribute name, if edges are to have different
levels of curvature.}

\item{edge.steps}{for curved edges (excluding loops), the number of line
segments to use for the curve approximation.}

\item{loop.steps}{for loops, the number of line segments to use for the
curve approximation.}

\item{object.scale}{base length for plotting objects, as a fraction of the
linear scale of the plotting region. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{uselen}{boolean; should we use \code{edge.len} to rescale edge
lengths?}

\item{suppress.axes}{boolean; suppress plotting of axes?}

\item{vertices.last}{boolean; plot vertices after plotting edges?}

specified in \code{mode}.}

coordinates

\description{
\code{plot.network} produces a simple two-dimensional plot of network
\code{x}, using optional attribute \code{attrname} to set edge values.  A
variety of options are available to control vertex placement, display
details, color, etc.
}
\details{
\code{plot.network} is the standard visualization tool for the
\code{network} class.  By means of clever selection of display parameters, a
fair amount of display flexibility can be obtained.  Vertex layout -- if not
specified directly using \code{coord} -- is determined via one of the
various available algorithms.  These should be specified via the \code{mode}
argument; see \code{\link{network.layout}} for a full list.  User-supplied
layout functions are also possible -- see the aforementioned man page for
details.

Note that where \code{is.hyper(x)==TRUE}, the network is converted to
bipartite adjacency form prior to computing coordinates.  If
\code{interactive==TRUE}, then the user may modify the initial network
layout by selecting an individual vertex and then clicking on the location
to which this vertex is to be moved; this process may be repeated until the
layout is satisfactory.
}
\note{
\code{plot.network} is adapted (with minor modifications) from the
\code{\link[sna]{gplot}} function of the \code{sna} library (authors: Carter
T. Butts and Alex Montgomery); eventually, these two packages will be
integrated.
